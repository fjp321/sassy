bash script to run from installation media to setup gentoo automagically
## Pre script
run net-setup to connect to internet, and ensure that connection is good by pinging www.gentoo.org. Next, partition the drive for a uefi system. I like to use [fdisk](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook:AMD64/Installation/Disks).
